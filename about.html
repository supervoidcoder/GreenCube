     <h1>How i created the Green Cube</h1>
      <div  id="journal">
          <p><span>So it all started when i found scratch. I saw that the most popular projects were platformers with cubes, and there were a lot of them. Cyclops cube, etc. I decided to create my own cube. The Blue Cube. I made some projects with it and then created his brother, the Green Cube, and started to Work with him more. I created an alt account, codetester1_2_3, mainly to test cloud projects in Scratch, but also to use the Blue Cube. Then, i created a lot of things with The Green Cube,then i got an idea to create a website with it. </span></p>
